# Meshroom v2021 in Colab
This repository contains a Google Colab notebook to run Alicevision's photogrammetry software [Meshroom](https://alicevision.org/#meshroom).

It's based off of [donmahallem](https://github.com/donmahallem)'s [MeshroomColab notebook](https://gist.github.com/donmahallem/22134574382b7bd8a67c1550734fcfc4) and [AB3D](https://github.com/abnlsn)'s [RunMeshroom notebook](https://github.com/abnlsn/colab-notebooks) and it's updated to work with Meshroom 2021, which uses a slightly different command line interface than the 2019 version.
